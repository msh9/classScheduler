This is the class scheduling program.

Currently it is split into three parts:
main.py: Does IO and should (??) contain the primary scheduling algorithm when finished
Class.py: Contains class definitions for types that will be class and PrerequisiteNode objects
PrerequisiteTree: Contains class(es) that will define graph that determines when classes can
be taken


As for the copyright stuff:
- We use pyparsing by Paul T. McGuire for parsing pieces of the input files
